#    returns a sentence like "Simba roars"
#    for each animal. (Hint: Meerkats bark
#    and Warthog grunt)

# 4. In interface.rb, create an array
#    with Simba, Nala, Timon & Pumbaa, iterate
#    over it and puts the sound each animal make
animals = [Lion.new("Simba"), Lion.new("Nala"), Meerkat.new("Timon"), Warthog.new("Pumbaa")]
animals.each do |animal|
  puts animal.talk
end

# 5. Implement a ::phyla class method which

# 6. Add an #eat(food) instance method
#    in Animal which returns a sentence
